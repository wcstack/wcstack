/**
 * updatedCallback.ts
 *
 * Utility function to invoke the StateClass lifecycle hook "$updatedCallback".
 *
 * Main responsibilities:
 * - Invokes $updatedCallback method if defined on the object (target)
 * - Callback is invoked with target's this context, passing IReadonlyStateProxy (receiver) as argument
 * - Executable as async function (await compatible)
 *
 * Design points:
 * - Safely retrieves $updatedCallback property using Reflect.get
 * - Does nothing if the callback doesn't exist
 * - Used for lifecycle management and update handling logic
